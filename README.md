# **BANKING CHURN ANALYSIS**
___

Churn is a measure of how many customers stop using a product or service. It is a common phenomenon in businesses and clients may churn for different reasons such better offers from competitors, being unhappy with the product or service being offered or even change in personal circumstances.

It is important for a business to keep the churn as minimal as possible and retain its clients therefore there is a need for a business to understand why clients are leaving so as to take the necessary steps to minimize the churning and retain their current clients.

In this project, we will conduct a churn analysis for a bank to address the ongoing challenge of customer attrition, which results in financial losses and diminished customer satisfaction. Understanding the factors that drive a client's decision to leave the bank will provide valuable insights to enhance retention strategies.

The Data was aquired from Kaggle.com

Objectives:

1. Conduct a comprehensive churn analysis for the bank.
2. Develop a machine learning model to predict customer churn and identify key factors contributing to it.
3. Provide actionable insights and recommend strategies to minimize churn rates and enhance client retention

# **BANKING CHURN ANALYSIS**

### **Project Overview**

Churn is a measure of how many customers stop using a product or service. It is a common phenomenon in businesses and clients may churn for different reasons such better offers from competitors, being unhappy with the product or service being offered or even change in personal circumstances.

It is important for a business to keep the churn as minimal as possible and retain its clients therefore there is a need for a business to understand why clients are leaving so as to take the necessary steps to minimize the churning and retain their current clients.

In this project, we will conduct a churn analysis for a bank to address the ongoing challenge of customer attrition, which results in financial losses and diminished customer satisfaction. Understanding the factors that drive a client's decision to leave the bank will provide valuable insights to enhance retention strategies.

The Data was aquired from Kaggle.com

### **Project Objectives**

1. Conduct a comprehensive churn analysis for the bank.
2. Develop a machine learning model to predict customer churn and identify key factors contributing to it.
3. Provide actionable insights and recommend strategies to minimize churn rates and enhance client retention

### **Conclusions**

From our  Analysis, we can derive the following insights:

1. There are more male customers than female customers, but the churn rate is higher among female customers.

3. Active customers outnumber non-active ones, yet non-active customers have the highest churn rate.

4. Credit card ownership does not appear to influence customer churn.

5. Customers with less than one year of tenure at the bank exhibit the highest churn rate.

6. Customers with more than two accounts tend to have higher churn rates than those with two or fewer accounts.

* **Feature Importance (Model Insight)**: According to the machine learning model, the top  features contributing to attrition are:

  * **Number of Products**
  * **Is Active Member**
 

  Conversely, the **least important features** include:

  * **Has Credit Card**
  * **Credit Score**

### **Recommendations**

To address the churn issues, the bank should consider the following strategies:

1. Target Female Customers: Focus on marketing strategies aimed at female customers by offering better incentives and enhancing customer service to improve retention rates.
    
2. Leverage Best Practices from France: Analyze the strategies used by the France branches and implement similar approaches in Germany and Spain to reduce churn rates in those regions.

3. Increase Customer Engagement: Engage non-active customers through follow-up communications and events to boost their involvement with the bank and lower churn rates.

4. Incentivize Fewer Accounts: Offer rewards or incentives to encourage customers to maintain two or fewer accounts, as customers with more accounts tend to churn at higher rates.

5. Encourage Long-Term Retention: Provide incentives or loyalty programs to encourage customers to stay with the bank for more than one year, addressing the higher churn rate among short-term clients.
